#### By Nicholas Raethke

## Description

This program works with the BufferedReader in Java to allow a User to choose food, beverages, and entertainment for a set number of people, and have an estimated cost returned. Additionally, it can except one of two discount codes.

## Setup

If you would like to view this program. Please fork it and open in a Java compatible IDE (I used IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition). If you run App.java, it should work. I worked on this with gradle and some imported Java libraries that should be visible at the top of App.java and Event.java

## Known Bugs

At this point the process will run once through and end without any bugs
